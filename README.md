# ML-Neural-Networks-on-MNIST-Fashion-Data
Neural network is a supervised classification model which mimics the structure of human brain. They are a model of interconnected nodes or neurons where one arrow denotes how the output from one node becomes an input for the next. There are several models of neural networks. The most used one are \textit{feed-forward neural networks} and \textit{recurrent neural networks}. In this project we mainly work with various types of \textit{feed-forward neural networks}. Using the MNIST-Fashion data set we show how the results vary for one-hidden layer NN, multi-layer NN and convolution NN.
